BalticWeb - Weather On Route - development


Just a development playground to get weather on route to work for Baltic Web.

1: Make env. for playing with OpenLayers 3

2: Make mock waypoints using rough import of RTZ from Baltic Web

3: Make pretty mock of weather on route with mouse/touch over for details with neat icons, as simple as possible.

4: Improve all the above.

5: Repeat until cpu dies of awe.
